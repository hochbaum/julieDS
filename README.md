# julieDS - A Nintendo DS emulator nobody asked for!
julieDS is a Nintendo DS emulator in the making, written in C and using the great [raylib library](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

## Compiling
For compiling simply run a `make` in the project root.

## The goal
The first milestone is being able to run [The smallest NDS file](http://imrannazar.com/The-Smallest-NDS-File). After that,
if I feel brave enough, it would be really cool to run a Pok√©mon Platinum or NSMB ROM.
